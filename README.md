Hi, I'm **Ouse** 👋  
A developer from **China**, currently a university student — and someone who's truly in love with **.NET** and **C#**.

### ❤️ My Passion

It all started with a simple `Console.WriteLine("Hello World");`  
Since then, I've been on a journey with **C#** and **.NET**, and every day I find something new to love.

- 💎 I love the elegance of **C#** syntax  
- ⚙️ I'm fascinated by the **.NET ecosystem** — from Blazor to EF Core, from WinForms to Web APIs  
- 🧪 I enjoy building tools, apps, and fun experiments just to learn more  
- 📖 Even when I'm not coding, I'm reading docs or watching videos about **.NET internals**  

I believe C# is not just a language — it's my favorite way to think, solve problems, and express ideas.
